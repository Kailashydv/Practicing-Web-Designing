	<h2> Webpages-I-Coded-Myself </h2>
	<p>
		I coded these webspages and designed them myself just to have fun. These designs are influenced by the Projects made by Jonas Schmedtmann whose courses I used to learn.

	<h2> Webpages-Designed-While-Learning </h2>
	<p>

	These webpages were coded while learning and doing online courses which also means these aren't my ideas and I was just following along. Still they provided a great opportunity to learn. These webpages were designed and coded by Jonas Schmedtmann.
