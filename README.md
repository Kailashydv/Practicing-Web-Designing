# Practicing-Web-Designing
These are the projects I did while Practicing HTML, CSS and SASS


## Webpages-I-Coded-Myself
I **coded** these webspages and **designed them myself** just to have fun. These designs are **influenced** by the Projects made by **Jonas Schmedtmann** whose courses I used to learn.

## Webpages-Designed-While-Learning
These webpages were coded while learning and doing online courses which also means these aren't my ideas and I was just following along. Still they provided a great opportunity to learn. These webpages were designed and coded by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.
